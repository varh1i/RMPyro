    <!--  This is an example how to specify the description of operators and the translation of it's key identifier
    to names. 

    This is how group ids are translated:

        <synopsis>The k-means problem is solved using Lloyd’s algorithm.
The average complexity is given by O(k n T), were n is the number of samples and T is the number of iteration.
The worst case complexity is given by O(n^(k+2/p)) with n = n_samples, p = n_features. (D. Arthur and S. Vassilvitskii, "How slow is the k-means method?" SoCG2006)
In practice, the k-means algorithm is very fast (one of the fastest clustering algorithms available), but it falls in local minima. That’s why it can be useful to restart it several times.</synopsis>
